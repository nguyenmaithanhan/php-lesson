            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>In Greek mythology, Elysion is part of the underworld, sometimes also called the Hades. It’s a place reserved for mortals related to the gods and other heroes. Later, it expanded to include those chosen by the gods, the righteous, and the heroic, where they would remain after death, to live a blessed and happy life.
                There you can find only the best and the purest. 
                This is exactly what we want to offer to our clients.</p>
                
            <p>Our agency ELYSION is a network agency headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. We also have offices in New York City, São Paulo, Berlin, Sydney, Tokyo, Moscow and Beijing. Thus, ELYSION has a total number of about 120 employees. Berlin has eleven permanent and four permanent-free employees.</p>
                
            <p>Among the regular employees are Marc Liehr as account manager, the media planning is done by Aline Hofmann and Jo von Deessen is the copywriter of the agency, while An Nguyen Mai Thanh works as a freelance designer for the agency.</p>
                
            <p>The logo is the outline of a head from which a light bulb, like an idea, springs. The light bulb should express the creative part of the work, the head the logical part. The signs around the head and the light bulb show the effects on the environment and the freedom that our employees at ELYSION experience.</p>
                
            <p>We specialise primarily in sustainable and digital advertising, especially on social media, but also we do not shy away from other channels, such as print media or TV spots.</p>
